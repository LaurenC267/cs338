1- AES - use diffie hellman to get the key first though.
since no AITM you can securly use diffie-hellman to agreee on a key and then use AES to safly convert message to ciphertext and 
then Bob can securly decipher the message.

2- generate random key and do H(M) and send it to bBob and Alice can encrypt it with her private key and bobs public key
Alice can encrypt the message using her own private key and then Bob can decrypt the message using Alices public key along with his private key
Therefore mal can't change the message without Bob ditecting the change

3- first- diffie-hellman key exchange. Second - key exchanges. Third - AES 
first they would use diffie-hellman to get an agreed apon secret key, then Bob would ask for Alice to prove herself using an AES ecryption with the key and a random number
that encryption is given to Alice and she can then decrypt it using her secret key pair. If the decrypted number and Bob's orginal random number match
then Alices identity has been varified as only she can decrypt the random number using her sercret key

4- Document got modified - you would have to modify the document and the signature so low possibility 
somebody stole Alics private key - That would make it easy for them to immitate Alice but also would mean alice was very insecure with her key
Alice may have sent the wrong contract on accident 

5- Sig_CA = E(S_CA, H(M))

6- Bob can give Alice M and his signature (M || signature) so that it equals E(s_B, H(M))-- Alice can then compute the H(M) using bobs public key and his signature and then can verify that
Bob is legit 

7- Mal could get ahold of bobs private key and thus impersinate him and provide a signature that looks like its from bob since it would use his private key
but would actually not been

Mal could somehow get the CA's private key and thus create her own certificate as Bob
