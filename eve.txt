The equasion Alice needs to decode for the shared secret is B**x % p
The equation Bob needs to decode for the shared secret is A**y %p

To do this we need to figire out how Alice got A and how Bob got Bo
They used the equations A=g**x %p and B=g**y %p

We can use this equation to figure out the values of x and y since we know what A, B, g, and p

-53 = 7**x % 97
-82 = 7**y % 97

-x = 22
-y = 41

We can now put the values into the equations to decode the shared secret

-82**22 % 97
-53**41 % 97

-Shared secret = 65

I couldn't figure this one out but I will walk through what I did

The public key Bob provides is (e, n)
so bobs e = 13 and his n = 16299

you get n by multiplying two prime numbers together p and q

n only has two factors, one being 389 * 419 , these are the only factors that are both prime numbers
thus I assumed p was 389 and q was 419.

now knowing p and q I could find the lcm of p-1 and q-1
lcm(388, 418) = 81092

That number can then be used to find int d which is used in bobs private ordered pair and is used to decrypt alices message

the equation is e*d%lcm = 1

so filling that in it's: 
13*d%81092 =1 

This is where I got stuck as I have no idea how to do that calculation and couldn't find any online calculator that would do it either

but essentially you would use this d to then take each segment of Alices ciphertext (y)
and preform the equation: y**d**n 

and you would then get the dectypted message
